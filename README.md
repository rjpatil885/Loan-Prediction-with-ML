# Loan Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid based on historical loan data. It leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist financial institutions in assessing loan applications.

## Key Features

* Data Preprocessing: The project handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes data visualization and correlation analysis to gain insights into the relationships between variables.
* Modeling: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier for prediction, taking advantage of its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.
* Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows users to interact with the models, input data, and view predictions without needing to interact with the underlying code.

## Dependencies

The project is built using Python and leverages the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the comprehensive process of building, evaluating, and deploying multiple machine learning models for loan repayment prediction. The inclusion of a GUI makes the tool accessible to non-technical users, enhancing its practical value for financial decision-making.
